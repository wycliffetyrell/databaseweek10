The data i choose was Social Media Users

# Difficulties
Data Cleaning and Consistency: One of the primary challenges was ensuring the consistency and cleanliness of the data. For instance, the interest category "Lifestlye" seems to be a typographical error and should be corrected to "Lifestyle".

Gender Diversity: The dataset includes non-binary gender categories, which is important for inclusivity but can be challenging if not all analysis tools support this category effectively.



## Interesting Observation
One interesting observation from the dataset is the distribution of social media platform usage among different professions and interests. For example, individuals interested in "Sports" predominantly use "Instagram," whereas those interested in "Lifestyle" and "Travel" have a more balanced usage across "YouTube" and "Facebook". This could suggest that "Instagram" has a stronger appeal to sports enthusiasts, which might be valuable information for targeted marketing strategies.
